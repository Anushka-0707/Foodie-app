**Food Ordering Application**

**Overview**

This project is a Food Ordering Application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The application allows users to browse through a variety of food items, select the ones they want to order, specify quantities, add items to the cart, and complete the purchase. Unlike traditional e-commerce platforms, this application doesn't integrate with a payment gateway. Instead, users can simulate the purchase process by adding items to the cart and clicking on the "buy" button, which marks the food items as ordered.

**Features**

**Browse Menu:** Users can view a list of available food items.
**Select and Customize:** Users can select desired food items and specify quantities.
**Add to Cart:** Selected items are added to the cart for checkout.
**Purchase Simulation:** Users can simulate the purchase process by clicking on the "buy" button without actual payment processing.
**Order History:** Users can view their order history.
